# HackerMan

This file contains all the arduino code that is used in the "meat counter" award winning project. 
The meat counter keeps track of the number of custoemrs within the store at any given time using IR lasers and sensors.
The meat counter accepts multiple inputs to adjust thresholds as well as modifies the current meat count.

The project was completed in < 24 hours for a hackathon so don't judge me too hard on how sloppy it looks :)
